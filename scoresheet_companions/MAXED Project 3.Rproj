# # Background 

Exercise Dependancy Scale (EDS) is a self report scale that utilizes the DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence to measure an individuals dependency to exercise. The scale is scored using a likert scale ranging from never (0) to always (5). Scores are derived by computing a total mean score as well as subscale mean scores. 

Sources that have examined the EDS and utilized it include

# # Scoresheet 

To clean the data 

rescored the likert scale from 6=never to 6=always 


# # Key Variables

'eds_mean' is the mean of all scores 

The variables below are the means of different subscales

'eds_withdrawl_effects' measures a persons withdrawl symptoms when they do not exercise or the actions they take to avoid withdrawl

'eds_continuance' the average score of a persons likelihood to continue exercise even when a physical or other problem persists

'eds_tolerance' tolerance is the continuing need for more exercise to reach the same effect 

'eds_lack_control' describes a persons inability to control their exercise behavior 

'eds_reduction_activities' other activies, including social and recreational, are reduced to make time for exercise  

'eds_time' a lot of time is spent exercising 

'eds_intention_effects' more exercise is completed than was intended

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
